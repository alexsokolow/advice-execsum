5. ROOT CAUSE INVESTIGATION

An investigation was conducted according to 6M methodology in order to identify the root cause. Each step concerning equipment cleaning, sampling and testing will be further investigated.

An OoL TOC on a tank could be caused by :

Presence of residue of carbon residue from the lot previously produced, due to a failed CIP - Contamination of the tank through the water used for CIP (WFI C102) - Contamination of the tank through the water used for pH-meter flush and sanitization (WFI C104)

Contamination of the tank following a maintenance activity - Contamination of the sample during sampling, the sampling point or the sampling equipment - Testing error

5.1. ENVIRONMENT

5.1.1. Analysis of CIP cycle

T22 is a non-protein, buffer tank in Purification L2 Post-Nano area and is used during the manufacturing of Cuvitru to prepare the dialysis buffer and the NaCl buffer used to clean the UF605.

T22 CIP cycle was performed and achieved on 12 September 2022 at 17h00 prior to EM sampling performed on 12 September 2022 around 17h21. The CIP was launched after an idle time following the production of Cuvitru lot BE13C095Z (end of production on the 09 September 2022), and before the production of Cuvitru lot BE13C097Z.

The CIP In-line conductivity (ref.: OSIPI database) results before (12 September 2022) and after EM sampling (14 September 2022) were satisfactory (1.40 and 1.31 µS/cm, respectively - ≤ 5.0 µS/cm (Ref.: SOP-013469)).

The CIP cycle of T22 followed the CIP 638-7 sequence as detailed in IT specification (Ref.: B2382_P_D_03_7.0_Design Specification - CIP Buffer & CIP UF & SOP-054471), as shown in Table 3.

The CIP lasted about three hours and 30 minutes. This is longer than what is usually observed when compared with other CIP cycles of T22 Tank in OSIPI database (up to 1h30 minutes). After the cleaning base step, the tank T22 is drained. When T22 weight is below 10kg, the final rinsing step is started. On 12 September 2022, after the cleaning base step, T22 weight could not get below 11kg. Therefore, the final rinsing step could not be started which caused the longer CIP time. However, the cleaning base and final rinsing steps duration were usual and were compliant. There is no reason to think that this longer CIP time would be the cause of an OoL TOC or a failed cleaning.

No alarms were reported during this CIP.

The condition of “NaOH Injection (Conductivity CE49561> 89,4 mS/cm during 40 s)” and circulation of cleaning base solution during 15 minutes in T22 tank as well as final rinsing step were held correctly as required by ITS sequence (see Figures 3 & 4).

The final CIP In-line conductivity measured for the CIP cycle of T22 tank performed on 12 September 2022 was 1.40 µS/cm which is below the limit validated to release a CIP cycle for routine manufacturing, i.e. ≤ 5.0 µS/cm (Ref.: SOP-013469). Additionally, the trend of T22 tank final CIP In-line conductivity (11 August 2022 – 21 September 2022), measured after the CIP of T22 did not show any negative tendency, (see Figure 5).

The injection of NaOH for station CIP638-7 is controlled via conductivity probe LECE49561 and final CIP In-line conductivity via conductivity probe LECE49549. These conductivity probes were verified by the metrology on, respectively, 10 September 2022 & 08 September 2022, and it was satisfactory (see Figures 8 & 9). The next due dates for these conductivity probes are, respectively, 10 March 2023 & 08 March 2023. No non-conformance events concerning these conductivity probes were reported.

The temperature of tank circulation C2 is controlled via temperature probe LETT49573. This conductivity probe was verified by metrology on 08 September 2022, and it was satisfactory (see Figure 10). The next due date for this probe is 08 March 2023. No non-conformance event concerning this probe was reported.

Tanks P13, P12 and Pipe TP653-TP605A in area R605 are cleaned in place as well by CIP638-7 station. These tanks are compliant for TOC for the year before the OoL TOC on T22 (from 12 September 2021 to 23 September 2022), see Figure.

CIP 638-7 station is connected to WFI loop 102. WFI loop C102 is also used for the EM sampling of tank T22. WFI loop C102 TOC was checked for the period of 01 August 2022 till 26 September 2022. NWA data demonstrated that TOC parameters are satisfactory (see Figure 13), i.e. not more than (NMT) 500 ppb according to SOP-026359.

Based on the considerations above, it can be concluded that the CIP cycle of T22 tank performed on 12 September 2022 was valid and the final conductivity of T22 measured in-line was 1.98 µS/cm (ref.: OSIPI database) which is below the limit validated to release a CIP cycle for routine manufacturing, i.e. ≤ 5.0 µS/cm (see Figure 5). A potential cross-contamination is therefore excluded.

WFI loop C104 is used for sanitization and flush of pH-meters used on tanks in the R605 area. WFI loop C104 TOC was checked for the period of 01 August 2022 till 26 September 2022. NWA data demonstrated that TOC parameters are satisfactory (see Figure 14),

5.1.2. Analysis of the sampling

Based on OSIPI data, EM samples were taken on 12 September 2022 at about 17h21 after the CIP cycle of T22 tank, completed on 12 September 2022 at 17h00. No activities were reported in T22 between end CIP and EM sampling (see Figure 8). It can be noticed that the sampling was performed within 48h (which is the validated clean hold time) after the end of the CIP cycle as per SOP-026466.

The EM sampling was performed according to SOP-026466 as following:

At Transfer panel (TP) TP605A, connect elbow « TP605A-4 » from « WFI » to «In T22 » - Fill up T22 with WFI (set-point = 45 Kg) - At Transfer panel TP605, connect elbow « 605-Pré-T22 » at « Out T22 » - Start the sampling function on HMI by selecting command "PRELEV" to open the tank bottom valve and take EM cleaning samples at transfer panel TP605C

In addition to EM sampling, the flexible TP605A-4 is only used to fill the tanks of the R605 area with WFI. The flexible “605-Pré-T22” is only used for EM sampling of T22 tank.

Cleaning status of small material single elbow “605-Pré-T22” is ensured by manual cleaning. Material was cleaned as per SOP- 048680 “LE09NE03031 - NETTOYAGE MANUEL DU MATERIEL”(cfr LE99FLNE352 – BE13C097Z).

It can be concluded that sampling is not the root cause of the out-of-limit TOC value measured on EM monitoring sample of T22 taken on 12 September 2022.

5.1.3. Analysis of the Testing

The laboratory investigation was performed using the 6M methodology. No potential root cause was identified for PR3016700 (ref.: PR2996517). All others testing performed on EM samples, i.e. pH, conductivity, LAL and bioburden were within the specified limits (see Table 2).

5.2. MATERIAL / MACHINE / EQUIPMENT

A review of the maintenance activities on the basis of JDE database was performed on T22, WFI loops C102 & C104, CIP station 638-7 and room 605 (from 11 August 2022 to 21 September 2022).

This review of maintenance activities assessed (ref.: Annexe 1 attached PR3016700 in TW8) that T22, WFI loops C102 & C104, CIP station 638-7 and room 605 were fully operational and that their integrity was ensured for the EM sampling. No potential root cause was identified.

It can be concluded that Material / Machine / Equipment is not the root cause of PR3016700.

5.3. RAW MATERIALS

NaOH 29% is the cleaning agent used for CIP of T22 tank. No carbon in that composition.

The TOC tube used to sample tank T22 on 12 September 2022 corresponds to lot number 21277- 4627. This lot number has been quarantined on 14 October 2022 as part of PR3060455 - Atypical trend of TOC occurrence for EM samples WFI, tanks, UF and columns from 02/Oct/22 to 07/Oct/22. This PR is still under investigation at the time.

It can be concluded that raw materials is not the root cause of PR3016700. Nonetheless, deviation PR3060455 has been opened on 14 October 2022 for an atypical trend in the occurrence OoL TOC observed for EM samples. This PR is still under investigation at the time.

5.4. MAN & METHOD

The laboratory investigation was performed using the 6M methodology. No potential root cause was identified for PR3016700 (ref.: PR2996517). Note that all others testing performed on EM cleaning samples, i.e. pH, conductivity, LAL and bioburden were within the specified limits (see Table 2). According to the laboratory investigation (ref.: PR2996517), the EM operator and QC analyst involved in the OoL treated here were in order of training : - EM sampling was performed as required in SOP-026466 “Prelevements des eaux de rincages des tanks”

The tests were performed as described in SOP-015413 “ Measurement of Total Organic Carbon with the use of TOC Sievers”.

An analysis of the above mentioned SOP’s revealed that they are explicit, as the methodology to be followed for the collection of rinse samples and their measurement.

It can be concluded that Man is not the root cause of PR3016700.

5.5. CHANGE & NON-CONFORMANCE EVENTS REVIEW

The change & non-conformance events (ref.: Trackwise 8) review was performed on the period from 11 August 2022 (last EM testing satisfactory) to 21 September 2022 (satisfactory retest of EM sampling). The research criteria applied were defined as following: “Zone 605”, “Tank T22”, “CIP station 638 7”, WFI loop C102 & C104”. No other non-conformance events were reported for T22 tank and CIP station 638-7 for the revised here period based on TW8 database. No change regarding research criteria was implemented for the revised here period based on TW8 database. The review of the maintenance activities performed on T22 between 11 August 2022 and 12 September 2022 was performed in the Facilities assessment of PR3016700.
